# Skicl

Skicl is a hybrid dialect of Lisp, Scheme and TCL, with influences from other languages: 

![Genealogy](docs/skicl_anchestors.png)

It has been designed to be small, easy to expand and easy to embed in host applications; it is made of a single C++ header and some additional Skicl files.

Skicl includes several advanced features among which:

* homoiconicity
* partial evaluation
* tail recursion
* static and dynamic scoping
* macros
* lambda functions with closures

For an overview on the language, please see [overview.tcl](examples/overview.tcl).
