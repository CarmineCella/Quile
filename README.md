It has been designed to be small, easy to expand and easy to embed in host applications; it is made of a single C++ header and some additional Skicl files.

Skicl includes several advanced features among which:

* homoiconicity
* partial evaluation
* tail recursion
* static and dynamic scoping
* lambda functions
